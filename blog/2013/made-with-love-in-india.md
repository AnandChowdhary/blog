# Made with ♥ in India

We’re a group of products and organizations which were proudly created in India.

You see this meticulously made handicraft item which would be the perfect addition to brighten up any living room. You pick it up, admiring the attention to detail when suddenly you spot the ‘Made in India’ label at the bottom, instantly making the product you were admiring seconds ago feel as cheap as dirt. Why is it that a ‘Made in Italy’ label makes people feel as if the product had been made in heaven itself? Why does it give the product a sense a class regardless of its quality? Now, imagine yourself with the beautifully made handicraft once again. You carefully inspect it in your hands when suddenly, you spot a label on the bottom, stating, “Made with love, in India.”

A warm feeling comes over you and a smile plays on your lips. You reach for your wallet and purchase the product.

Thus, we’re launching the ‘Made with ♥ in India’ initiative, a purely positive non-profit movement with an objective to celebrate, promote, and build a brand, India.

> “A small thing, a simple gesture, can brighten up someone’s day and remind them that they should be proud of helping local businesses and entrepreneurs who contribute largely to the economy. Be proud of buying products made on India; after all, you too are one of India’s many fine products.”

We’d love it if you could collaborate and become a part of a change; a revolution. All you need to do is add a ‘Made with ♥ in India’ in your website or product. You can attribute us on our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/madewithloveinindia). That’s it!

Welcome to Made with ♥ in India.
