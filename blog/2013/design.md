# Design

Design is the art of expressing thoughts. It is a freehand manifestation of vision. It is the draftsman’s job to use
lab instruments to reflect that vision into precision. The purpose of design is to understand how best we can absorb
natural elements spread all around us.

Lack of knowledge creates too many complexities around us. Outside wisdom is unlikely to remove these intricacies. It
is from the study of the self, through concentration and practice, emerges design. Total simplicity of the cosmic
order. From creation to another creation, and **yet another**. Unlimited forms, shapes, variants and matter — all bound
together by the invisible force of life.

Symmetry in true harmony, yet not perfectly symmetrical. Continuous friction causing everything to turn round-cornered.
How visually appealing look the electrons in an atom, or iOS icons! It is that appeal in the design that raises
inquisitiveness to know more of the unknown. _Sometimes, even surpassing logic._

Inter-dependence is intrinsic to design. Just like in a machine, different parts behave differently to serve distinct
objectives; and to that end not only do they work in harmony but also are interdependent, to receive and to deliver,
meeting the intended aim. Civilization, spread through thousands of years of natural evolution, has established
societies functioning with different classes of people in total inter-dependence. A similar inter-dependence is between
How and Why. When you understand the objective and the context of a work, that’s when you answer How and start to make
it useful. I couldn’t have framed this any better than Frank Chimero, in his book ‘The Shape of Design.’

Design is future. It is a reaction against the contemporary, both technology and belief system. It is basically a
blueprint which lays the foundation for newer development. Design is simplification, but not just limited to the
removal of clutter: Just how Sir Jony Ive (SVP of Design, Apple) says, how the whole thing works on so many levels;
bringing order to complexity; giving the user what they want only when they want it. From a watch to a coffee mug to a
scooter, there is a profound beauty in simplicity, clarity, and efficiency.

I believe in _design_, not decoration.

Making things _useful_, not usable.

_Experiences_, not interfaces.
