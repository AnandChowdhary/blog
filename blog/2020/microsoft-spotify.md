# Microsoft should buy Spotify

- The new Microsoft is the least "evil" in Big Tech, and even shares some of Spotify's values
- Spotify needs to make money and that's why they'll lose
  - Music streaming is a zero sum game because everyone has all the music
  - Apple, Google, and Amazon don't have to earn money; music is just an addon to sell something else
  - Microsoft can give that support to Spotify and make it competitive
- Spotify will now be built-in in the 1B+ Windows 10 devices and 100M+ Xbox devices
- Spotify is already in Microsoft-friendly markets like the US, Europe, and even India
- Original content is a non-zero sum game, so everyone wins -- Netflix, Disney, (but not Apple)
  - With GIMET and others, Spotify is entering the original content market for podcasts
  - Microsoft hasn't done much consumer addon services (remember Groove music? Nobody does)
  - Microsoft is also happy getting back into the consumer space with their recent enterprise focus
