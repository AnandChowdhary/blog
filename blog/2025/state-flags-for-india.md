# State flags for India

I've always wanted to design state flags for India - I'm a big fan of the Japanese prefecture flags and have felt envious of countries like the Netherlands that have state flags. Flags instill pride and give the people a symbol to rally around.

I worked with ChatGPT's new Agent to research the history, cultural symbols, and any existing concepts or local tastes for each Indian state to design these flag.s The colours and motifs are selected to evoke distinctive local tastes while remaining respectful of national symbols (the Indian tricolour and Ashoka Chakra) and court rulings (e.g., S.R. Bommai v. Union of India affirmed that states may have their own flags provided they do not dishonour the national flag).

## Andhra Pradesh

### Context

Andhra Pradesh has ancient roots in the Andhra kingdom, flourishing during Satavahana and Vijayanagar periods. Its emblem features a Dhamma Chakka (wheel of law), triratna symbols and a Poorna Kalasam (vase of plenty) inspired by Buddhist art. State symbols include the blackbuck (animal), rose‑ringed parakeet (bird), jasmine (flower), neem (tree) and the state sport kabaddi.
