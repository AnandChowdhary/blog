# State flags for India

I've always wanted to design state flags for India - I'm a big fan of the Japanese prefecture flags and have felt envious of countries like the Netherlands that have state flags. Flags instill pride and give the people a symbol to rally around.

I worked with ChatGPT's new Agent to research the history, cultural symbols, and any existing concepts or local tastes for each Indian state to design these flag.s The colours and motifs are selected to evoke distinctive local tastes while remaining respectful of national symbols (the Indian tricolour and Ashoka Chakra) and court rulings (e.g., S.R. Bommai v. Union of India affirmed that states may have their own flags provided they do not dishonour the national flag).

## Andhra Pradesh

### Context

Andhra Pradesh has ancient roots in the Andhra kingdom, flourishing during Satavahana and Vijayanagar periods. Its emblem features a Dhamma Chakka (wheel of law), triratna symbols and a Poorna Kalasam (vase of plenty) inspired by Buddhist art. State symbols include the blackbuck (animal), rose‑ringed parakeet (bird), jasmine (flower), neem (tree) and the state sport kabaddi.

### Meaning

- Colors:
  - Pale green symbolising the fertile Krishna–Godavari delta and the rich agricultural landscape
  - Light saffron evokes knowledge and dharma
- Symbols:
  - Poorna Kalasam inspired by Buddhist art and a symbol of abundance and "source of life" in the Vedas
  - Dhamma Chakka referencing the official emblem and the state's Buddhist heritage

## Arunachal Pradesh

### Context

The "land of dawn‑lit mountains," Arunachal has steep forested hills rising to snow‑capped peaks and is home to 26 major tribes. The 17th‑century Tawang Monastery and the presence of rare big cats (tiger, clouded leopard and snow leopard) signify spiritual and ecological richness, and the official symbols include the mithun (state animal), great hornbill (bird), foxtail orchid (flower) and hollong tree.

### Meaning

- Colors:
  - Blue: The vastness of the eastern Himalayan skies and the ethereal glow of dawn, an homage to Arunachal's name: "Land of the dawn-lit mountains" and also reflects the region’s many rivers and misty horizons
  - Golden yellow for the rising sun that evokes the daily rebirth of light over the mountains, mirroring the presence of the Tawang Monastery as a beacon of Buddhist wisdom
  - Deep green for the timeless silhouette of the rugged terrain - ancient, protective, and forested - echoing the Hollong tree and the dense biodiversity of the region
- Symbols:
  - Rising sun symbolise spiritual dawn
  - Mountainous terrain and the Brahmaputra

## Assam

### Context

Assam is called the "land of red rivers and blue hills" and blends Indo-Burmese, Mongolian and Aryan influences. Bihu, celebrated thrice a year, honours agricultural cycles, and traditional textiles (mekhela chador, gamucha) and crafts (silk weaving, brass work) are iconic. State symbols include the one‑horned rhino (animal), white‑winged wood duck (bird), foxtail orchid (flower) and Hollong tree.

- Colors:
  - Deep red recalling the "red rivers" and the gamucha border along with traditional textile borders (e.g., gamucha, mekhela chador)
  - Light gold represents the woven mekhela chador in natural fibers, earthy femininity and handloom grace, a thread that ties the identity together
