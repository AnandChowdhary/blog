# Zomato for Android Redesign

I took fifteen minutes to make some strategic design changes to Zomato's Android app. I wrote extensively about the iconography, typography, and role of actions in the appâ€™s user experience. I wrote this article originally in March 2016 for the Zomato Android team and publicly published it on Medium in April 2017 since Zomato decided to implement most of my design changes.
